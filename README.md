Twitter Clone Frontend
This is a simple frontend for a Twitter-like app. It lets users log in, view tweets, and post their own tweets.

Features
Login: Users can log in using predefined credentials.
Tweet Feed: Displays a list of tweets.
Post Tweets: Users can write and post new tweets.
Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile screens.
Technologies Used
HTML: To structure the web pages.
CSS: To style the app.
JavaScript: To make the app interactive.
How to Use
Download or Clone the project:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/twitter-clone-frontend.git
Open the folder and double-click on the index.html file to open it in a browser.
Log In using the credentials:
Username: user123
Password: password123
After logging in, you can:
View tweets on the home page.
Write and post new tweets.
Use the top bar to navigate or log out.
How It Works
The app uses JavaScript to simulate features like login and posting tweets.
Tweets are only stored in memory (not saved permanently).
Logging out will redirect you to the login page.
Planned Improvements
Add a backend for saving tweets and real user accounts.
Allow users to edit their profiles and view others' profiles.
Add live updates for new tweets.
